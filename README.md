## Contribution Guidelines

When adapting a new application, create a new folder under `packages`. The repository no longer separates `global/package`; all icons are treated as package content. Software-specific loose adaptation files belong in `required/` and are published as mandatory downloads.

File grouping rules:

- `monochrome*.svg/png` is grouped as `monet`
- `recbg*.svg/png` and `recfg*.svg/png` are grouped as `light`
- `rec_night*.svg/png` is grouped as `dark`
- `mat*.svg/png` is grouped as `mat`
- Any other filename is treated as a required file

Then follow the specifications below:

### 1. Size Specifications

| Size | Pixels  |
| ---- | ------- |
| 1x1  | 240x240 |
| 1x2  | 240x820 |
| 2x1  | 820x240 |
| 2x2  | 704x704 |

### 2. File Naming Rules

- Classic icons: background `recbg.svg` / foreground `recfg.svg` (supports all sizes)
- Dark mode: foreground only `rec_night.svg` (supports all sizes)
- Monet icons: `monochrome.svg` (supports all sizes)
- Material icons: `mat.svg` (only supports 1x1)

> Naming example: To adapt a 2x2 Monet icon, name it `monochrome_2x2.svg`.

### 3. SVG Conversion Tool

If the SVG format is difficult to draw directly, you can use the built-in conversion script to convert PNG files to SVG:

- Script Path: scripts/convert_svg.py
- Usage: `scripts/convert_svg.py <target_directory>`

> Before using the conversion script, please ensure that `Pillow` and `zopfli` are installed in your environment.
